# Welcome.
I will be using this space as an outlet for my projects, turials, and whatever else I deem interesting enough to share. If you decide to follow my blog, expect a wide array of of topics covered without a central focus.

## About me
My current title is Senior Systems Engineer but I see myself as a SysAdmin with a heavy focus on developing scripts, tools, and software to streamline and automate whatever comes across my desk. My role is a mixture of Mac and Windows but I predominently work with PowerShell and Python, and I'll dabble here and there writing in C# and shell scripting.
